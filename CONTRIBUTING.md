## Commit Message

A good commit message should answer three questions:

1. **Why is it necessary?** It may fix a bug, add a feature, improve
performance, reliability, stability, or just be a change for the sake
of correctness.
2. **How does it address the issue?** For short obvious patches this part
can be omitted, but it should be a high level description of what the
approach was.
3. **What effects does the patch have?** (In addition to the obvious ones,
this may include benchmarks, side effects, etc.)

Structure your commit message like this:

```
Capitalized, short (50 chars or less) summary

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to about 72
characters or so.  In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body.  The blank
line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the
two together.

Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not
"Fixed bug" or "Fixes bug". This convention matches up with commit
messages generated by commands like git merge and git revert.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

- Bullet points are okay, too

- Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, followed by a
  single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here

- Use a hanging indent

Fixes #5678 (commit will be linked to the issue, which will be marked
as resolved when pushing the commit).
```

**DO**

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mode ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
- Limit the first line to [50 characters or less](http://stopwritingramblingcommitmessages.com/).
- Always leave the second line blank (if there's more than just the title).
- Line break the commit message (to make the commit message readable without
having to scroll horizontally).
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally.

**DON'T**

- Don't end the summary line with a period - it's a title and titles don't end
with a period.
- Never use the `-m <msg>`/`--message=<msg>` flag to `git commit`; it gives you
a poor mindset as you will feel that you have to fit your commit message into
the terminal command, and makes the commit feel more like a one-off argument
than a page in history.

**Tips**

- If it seems difficult to summarize what your commit does, it may be because
it includes several logical changes or bug fixes, and are better split up into
several commits using `git add -p`.
