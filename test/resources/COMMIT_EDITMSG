Fix broken crypto_register_instance() module

Commit 9c521a2 ("crypto: api - remove instance when test failed")
tried to grab a module reference count before the module was even set.

Worse, it then goes on to free the module reference count after it is
set so you quickly end up with a negative module reference count which
prevents people from using any instances belonging to that module.

This patch moves the module initialization before the reference count.
